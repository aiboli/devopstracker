# devopstracker
Our Chromium extension will give you both a preview of unchecked updates through badge notifications right in your browser, as well as present all changes to your monitored work items in a clean, presentable format - allowing you to directly visit these items from the click of a button and not juggle through your Inboxes and Bookmarks.
